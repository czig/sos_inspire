                                    Capt told first officer to wake him with status update at 0600 if 
                                    Scilly Isles are not seen by then

                                    First officer sees ship is off course by 8 miles (thought Isles would be to right, but they appeared to left). Corrects course. Notifies Capt Rugiati, who admonishes him and tells him to change course back to it was. Capt gives First Officer his intent for passing Isles here (intends to go between Isles and Seven Stones Reef).
                                </li>
                                <li>0800: new watch is very inexperienced (maiden voyage for both members) and doesn't know captain's intent</li>
                                <li>0818: Capt Rugiati changes course to move to port of Seven Stones Reef, but fails to compensate for wind and ocean current</li>
                                <li>0830: SS Torrey Canyon runs into submerged fishing nets; presence of more fishing nets prevents him from turning harder to port</li>
                                <li>0840: Fishing vessels to port of SS Torrey Canyon, while no fishing vessels and deep water to starboard, but Capt Rugiati turns to port. When they finally get a good reading and realize the danger at hand, confusion about steering controls in last 10 minutes compounded the issue. Last manuever is a hard turn to port</li>
